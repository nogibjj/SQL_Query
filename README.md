# SQL_Query
This is Qiheng's repo for IDS 706 project 3 SQL Query.

## Overview
In this project we test and generate a python script that queries a database by using Sqlite. The dataset is adopted from [Kaggle: Udemy Courses](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/udemy-courses).

Initially, we learn basic syntax from [Leetcode SQL](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/sql-language/), then we interact with the dataset through notebook to ensure all scripts are workable. Finally, we establish our database through sqlite and complte the python scipt.

As the udemy is a popular learning platform, we decide use the dataset realted to this website to find out several interesting information through SQL query:
1. What are the levels of courses are the platform providing?
2. What is the most popular beginner-level course?
3. What is the number of free courses and paid courses?
4. Based on 3, what is propotion of the beginner-level courses in the free and paid courses?
5. Based on 3, what is propotion of the beginner-level courses with high rate (over 0.85) in the free and paid courses?

## Usage
